# Railway Deployment Guide - Enterprise Architecture

## Step-by-Step Railway Deployment Instructions

This guide covers deployment of the enterprise-grade Trading Compliance Portal with layered architecture, comprehensive security, and PostgreSQL database.

### Prerequisites
1. GitHub account with the repository
2. Railway account (sign up at railway.app)
3. Basic understanding of environment variables
4. Understanding of PostgreSQL (Railway provides this automatically)

### Step 1: Connect to Railway

1. **Visit Railway**: Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. **Sign in**: Use your GitHub account to sign in
3. **New Project**: Click "New Project"
4. **Deploy from GitHub**: Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
5. **Select Repository**: Choose your trading approval repository
6. **Deploy**: Click "Deploy Now"

Railway will automatically:
- Detect it's a Node.js application
- Use the `nixpacks.toml` configuration
- Install dependencies with `npm ci --only=production`
- Start the app with `npm start`

### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

In your Railway project dashboard:

1. **Go to Variables tab**
2. **Add the following variables**:

#### Required Variables:
```
# Core Application Settings
NODE_ENV=production
SESSION_SECRET=your-super-secure-random-key-at-least-32-chars
ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-secure-admin-password-here
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://[auto-provided-by-railway]

# Optional Application Settings  
PORT=3000
LOG_LEVEL=info
FRONTEND_URL=https://your-app-name.up.railway.app
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: Railway automatically provides `DATABASE_URL` for PostgreSQL - do not set this manually.

#### Optional Microsoft 365 Integration:
```
AZURE_CLIENT_ID=your-azure-client-id
AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-azure-client-secret
AZURE_TENANT_ID=your-azure-tenant-id
REDIRECT_URI=https://your-app-name.up.railway.app/api/auth/microsoft/callback
POST_LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URI=https://your-app-name.up.railway.app
```

#### Optional Email Configuration:
```
EMAIL_USER=your-email@company.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password
EMAIL_FROM=compliance@company.com
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
```

### Step 3: Generate Secure Secrets

For `SESSION_SECRET`, generate a secure random string:
```bash
# Using Node.js
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"

# Or use online generator (use a trusted one)
# Or create your own: minimum 32 characters, mix of letters, numbers, symbols
```

### Step 4: Get Your App URL

1. **In Railway Dashboard**: Your app URL will be shown in the deployment section
2. **Format**: Usually `https://your-app-name.up.railway.app`
3. **Custom Domain**: You can add a custom domain in the Settings tab

### Step 5: Microsoft 365 Setup (Optional)

If you want Single Sign-On:

1. **Azure Portal**: Go to [portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com)
2. **App Registrations**: Create new registration
3. **Redirect URI**: Add your Railway URL + `/api/auth/microsoft/callback`
4. **Certificates & Secrets**: Create a client secret
5. **Copy Values**: Client ID, Client Secret, Tenant ID to Railway environment variables

### Step 6: First Access

1. **Visit Your App**: Go to your Railway URL
2. **Admin Login**: Use the credentials you set in environment variables
3. **Change Passwords**: Immediately change default admin password
4. **Add Restricted Stocks**: Use admin panel to add any restricted stocks
5. **Test Employee Flow**: Create a test trading request

### Step 7: Monitoring

Railway provides:
- **Logs**: View application logs in real-time
- **Metrics**: CPU, memory, network usage
- **Health Checks**: Automatic monitoring via `/health` endpoint
- **Deployments**: History of all deployments

### Step 8: Database Management

Railway provides managed PostgreSQL database:
- **PostgreSQL Instance**: Automatically provisioned and managed
- **Automatic Backups**: Railway handles database backups
- **Data Persistence**: All data persists between deployments
- **Auto-initialization**: Database schema created on first run
- **Built-in Backup**: App includes `/admin-backup-database` endpoint for manual exports
- **High Availability**: Railway ensures database uptime and performance

### Step 9: Application Architecture Features

This deployment includes enterprise-grade features:

#### üèóÔ∏è **Layered Architecture**
- Controllers handle HTTP requests/responses
- Services contain business logic  
- Models manage database operations
- Middleware handles security, validation, logging

#### üîí **Security Features**
- Rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
- Comprehensive input validation and sanitization
- Centralized error handling with proper logging
- Audit trail for all user actions
- Session security with configurable expiration

#### üìä **Monitoring & Logging**
- Winston structured logging with request correlation IDs
- Health check endpoint at `/health` for Railway monitoring
- Database status endpoint at `/db-status` (admin only)
- Complete audit logging for compliance requirements

#### üîç **Advanced Reporting Features**
- **Dynamic Sorting**: All reporting tables support sorting by Request ID, Date, or Ticker
- **Real-time Updates**: Tables update instantly when changing sort options
- **CSV Exports**: Full data export with current sorting and filtering applied
- **Advanced Filtering**: Date ranges, ticker search, trading type selection
- **Visual Indicators**: Clear display of current sort field and direction
- **URL Parameters**: Sorting state preserved in URLs for bookmarking

## Security Checklist

Before going live:

- [ ] Set strong SESSION_SECRET (32+ characters, cryptographically secure)
- [ ] Configure secure ADMIN_USERNAME and ADMIN_PASSWORD
- [ ] Verify HTTPS is enabled (automatic on Railway)
- [ ] Test rate limiting on authentication endpoints
- [ ] Verify input validation is working on all forms
- [ ] Test Microsoft 365 integration if enabled
- [ ] Add restricted stocks as needed via admin panel
- [ ] Test complete employee workflow (request ‚Üí approval/rejection)
- [ ] Verify audit logging is capturing all actions
- [ ] Test database backup functionality
- [ ] Test dynamic sorting functionality on admin and employee tables
- [ ] Verify CSV export includes correct sorting and filtering
- [ ] Review application logs for any security warnings

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **App won't start**: Check environment variables are set correctly
2. **Microsoft 365 login fails**: Verify redirect URIs match exactly
3. **Database issues**: Check logs for PostgreSQL/SQLite errors
4. **Health check fails**: Ensure `/health` endpoint responds
5. **Sorting not working**: Check that JavaScript is enabled and CSP allows inline scripts
6. **Tables not updating**: Verify network connection and check browser console for errors

### Checking Logs:

1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Click on your project
3. Select "Deployments" tab
4. Click "View Logs" on latest deployment

### Getting Help:

- Check Railway documentation
- Review application logs
- Verify environment variable values
- Test health check endpoint: `https://your-app.railway.app/health`
