## Architecture Overview

The application follows enterprise-grade architectural patterns:

### üèóÔ∏è **Layered Architecture**
- **Controllers**: Handle HTTP requests/responses (`AdminController`, `EmployeeController`, `TradingRequestController`)
- **Services**: Business logic layer (`AdminService`, `TradingRequestService`)
- **Models**: Data access layer with BaseModel pattern (`TradingRequest`, `RestrictedStock`, `AuditLog`)
- **Middleware**: Security, validation, error handling, and logging

### üîí **Security Features**
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation middleware with sanitization
- **Rate Limiting**: Configurable rate limits for authentication and admin actions
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling with development/production modes
- **Audit Logging**: Complete activity tracking with request correlation IDs
- **Session Security**: Secure session configuration with proper CSRF protection

### üìä **Monitoring & Logging**
- **Winston Logging**: Structured logging with request correlation
- **Health Checks**: Built-in health monitoring for Railway deployment
- **Security Events**: Dedicated security event logging for compliance

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Railway) / SQLite (local development)
- **Authentication**: Microsoft 365 OAuth 2.0 integration + email-based fallback
- **Architecture**: MVC pattern with service layer and middleware
- **Security**: Helmet, rate limiting, input validation, audit logging
- **Deployment**: Railway-optimized with health checks and environment detection

## Deployment Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Railway account
- Microsoft 365 app registration (optional)
- Basic knowledge of environment variables

### Step 1: Deploy to Railway
1. Connect your GitHub repository to Railway
2. Railway will automatically detect the Node.js application
3. The app will deploy using the provided `railway.json` and `nixpacks.toml`

### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables
In Railway dashboard, add these **required** environment variables:

```bash
# Core Application (Required)
NODE_ENV=production
SESSION_SECRET=your-secure-random-32-character-key-here
ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-secure-admin-password
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://[auto-provided-by-railway]

# Optional Application Settings
PORT=3000
LOG_LEVEL=info
FRONTEND_URL=https://your-app.railway.app
```

### Step 3: Optional Microsoft 365 Setup
If you want SSO integration:
```bash
AZURE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
AZURE_TENANT_ID=your-tenant-id
REDIRECT_URI=https://your-app.railway.app/api/auth/microsoft/callback
POST_LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URI=https://your-app.railway.app
```

### Step 4: Access the Application
- Navigate to your Railway-provided URL
- Login with admin credentials (set via environment variables)
- Start managing trading requests and restricted stocks

## Security Configuration

‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL SECURITY**: Configure these environment variables before deployment:
- **SESSION_SECRET**: Generate a secure 32+ character random string
- **ADMIN_USERNAME**: Set a secure admin username 
- **ADMIN_PASSWORD**: Set a strong admin password

## Database

The application supports both PostgreSQL (production) and SQLite (development):
- **Railway Deployment**: Automatically uses PostgreSQL with `DATABASE_URL`
- **Local Development**: Falls back to SQLite if no `DATABASE_URL` provided
