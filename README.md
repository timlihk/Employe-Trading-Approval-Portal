### Step 1: Deploy to Railway
1. Connect your GitHub repository to Railway
2. Railway will automatically detect the Node.js application
3. The app will deploy using the provided `railway.json` and `nixpacks.toml`

### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables
In Railway dashboard, add these **required** environment variables:

```bash
# Core Application (Required)
NODE_ENV=production
SESSION_SECRET=your-secure-random-32-character-key-here
ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-secure-admin-password
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://[auto-provided-by-railway]

# Optional Application Settings
PORT=3000
LOG_LEVEL=info
FRONTEND_URL=https://your-app.railway.app
```

### Step 3: Optional Microsoft 365 Setup
If you want SSO integration:
```bash
AZURE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
AZURE_TENANT_ID=your-tenant-id
REDIRECT_URI=https://your-app.railway.app/api/auth/microsoft/callback
